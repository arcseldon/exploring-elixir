# ExploringElixir

Contains code examples used in the Exploring Elixir screencast series:

  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFKQ85T69sYhifDHF7dnPgw

Code for each episode is typically found in lib/exploring_elixir/e###/
Note that this is not a "coherent" Elixir application, but rather the
collection of snippets and modules used in the screencasts.

The usual `mix do deps.get, compile` should suffice to try it out.
Benchmarks should be run with `MIX_ENV=prod`.

Thanks to everyone who contributes to Elixir and its community, with
a special thanks to the authors of the libraris used in this reposity!
